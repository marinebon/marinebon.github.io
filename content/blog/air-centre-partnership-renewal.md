A partnership renewal has been announced between the Marine Biodiversity
Observation Network (MBON) and the Atlantic International Research
Centre (AIR Centre), for the continuation of a Secretariat to coordinate
the global MBON.
The MBON and the AIR Centre share a common vision of the building and
coordination of a global ocean biodiversity observation system. Both
entities recognize the importance of interoperable and open-access
information on biodiversity variables, to highlight trends in biological
diversity and ecosystem functioning, with direct impacts on the
well-being and development of today’s society. Understanding the
evolution and functions of biodiversity and ecosystem services is now of
crucial importance, not only for scientific reasons but also to meet the
demand from policymakers, managers, and stakeholders for
scientific-based tools.

The renewal agreement between the MBON and the AIR Centre recognizes
ongoing cooperation to reinforce ocean biodiversity observing capacity
to make use of the best available resources and expertise. The
organizations focus on building global capacity for data collection,
management, and open publication by sharing best practices and
strengthening the exchange of ideas and integration with global marine
observing and data initiatives. These include the Intergovernmental
Oceanographic Commission (IOC-UNESCO, including the Ocean Biodiversity
Information System (OBIS), the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), the
Ocean Best Practices System (OBPS), and the Ocean Teacher Global Academy
(OTGA)), the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the GEO-Biodiversity
Observation Network (GEO BON), regional initiatives like the
Asia-Pacific BON/MBON and the Americas MBON including the MBON Americas
Pole-to-Pole effort, national programs, and individual academic, private
sector, and government agencies and programs.
The MBON is the key biodiversity pillar of the Group on Earth
Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) for the marine
realm. As a community of practice, the MBON facilitates the coordination
of individual monitoring programs and existing networks focused on
local, regional, and thematic aspects of marine biology and
biodiversity, to improve standards and best practices in the collection,
management, and publication of marine biodiversity data and the status
and trends of ecosystems and their services. The MBON Secretariat
coordinates and focuses the MBON community of practice on solving
problems of society.
Considering the importance of studying Atlantic biodiversity, as well as
of joining efforts, at a global level, to provide current, accurate, and
comprehensive data, information, and knowledge about biodiversity, the
AIR Centre and its Earth Observation Laboratory (EO Lab) located in
Terceira Island, Azores, is committed to continue providing technical
and logistical support to the MBON Secretariat with the allocation of
dedicated staff.
Through mutual support the AIR Centre and the MBON aim to consolidate
strategic scientific and technological areas for the Atlantic; enhance
the benefits of research in partnership, strengthening the relationship
between research, technology, and innovation; promote the development of
transregional and transnational cooperation projects in technological
research and development; stimulate the development of partnerships that
promote research and innovation; and provide coordination and leadership
to the international, global GEO BON MBON community.
“\*It was with great pleasure that I saw the commitment to foster an
ongoing collaboration dialogue to support the international science and
operations community by standing up the MBON\*”, says Joana Soares,
Executive Secretary of MBON and Project Officer of the AIR Centre. “\*We
need such networks to bring different people together to work on
difficult questions like where marine life exists and how and why it is
changing. The knowledge will help to make a sustainable use of the ocean
for the benefit of our own and future generations”\*.
\*\*The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON)\*\* is a thematic
node of the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network
(GEO BON). It facilitates networking amongst the marine biodiversity
community to improve standards and best practices in the collection,
management, and open publication of marine biodiversity data. The MBON
coordinates the community of practice for the Marine Life 2030 Programme
endorsed by the Ocean Decade. \*\*Marine Life 2030\*\* helps to network
different partners to achieve the goals of the UN Ocean Decade,
especially those relevant to marine life and life in general.
\*\*The AIR Centre\*\* is an internationally networked organization,
oriented to foster job creation and knowledge-driven sustainable
economic development in Atlantic regions. It addresses and integrates
space, climate, earth, ocean, energy, and data sciences and promotes
cooperation in alignment with national/regional priorities and global
challenges. It builds on and expands the abilities of individual
organizations, and it advances selected scientific and technological
domains and their constellations of actors towards shared targets.
