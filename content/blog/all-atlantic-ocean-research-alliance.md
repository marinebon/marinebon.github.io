The All-Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance Forum held a Scientific Event
in Brasilia (Brazil) from May 21 to June 2, 2022
The All-Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance Forum held a Scientific Event
in Brasilia (Brazil) from May 21 to June 2, 2022. The Marine
Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) partnered with the Ocean Best
Practices System (OBPS), the Ocean Biodiversity Information System
(OBIS), and the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) of the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) to hold a virtual side
event to advance the co-design of solutions that require biology and
ecosystem observations integrated with traditional ocean observing.
Emerging technologies now make it possible to incorporate biology and
ecosystem Essential Ocean Variables (EOV) observations as well as
Biodiversity Essential Variables (EBV) into surveys and monitoring
programs at local and regional scales. Best practices allow for this
information to be interoperable, scalable, usable, and implementable by
local groups and nations, and across ocean basins.
This session promoted dialogue about local stakeholder needs for
monitoring, information, and capacity development in different parts of
the Atlantic. MBON provides a platform for such a community of practice.
The MBON secretariat, hosted by the AIR Centre Earth Observation (EO)
Laboratory at Terceira Island-Azores, helps coordinate and focus the
community of practice on addressing societal problems in the face of the
climate and biodiversity crisis.

During this side event, experts and stakeholders reviewed co-design
strategies conducted under the MBON and the Marine Life 2030 Programme
endorsed by the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.
The strategy is based on three pillars of action: Learning Together,
Observing Life, and Building Solutions. The cross-cutting elements are
efforts to share knowledge and build communities, converge on standards
for observing and data management, and developing metrics of success
through co-design. The implementation includes the MBON Pole to Pole
framework for local observations of marine life and biodiversity using a
basin-scale framework for interoperability, building on regional
elements of GOOS and guidelines for data flow developed by OBIS and
OBPS.
The goal is to better manage ocean uses and satisfy national reporting
requirements for targets of Sustainable Development Goals, the post-2020
Convention on Biological Diversity, and other national and international
frameworks.
Participants developed [the following
statement](storage/2022/09/Statement-MBON\_All-Atlantic2022.pdf) as an
outcome of the side event.
The outcomes of the Scientific Event were highlighted at the Ministerial
Event that took place July 13-14, 2022, in Washington, D.C. (USA). MBON
and Marine Life 2030 join the conversations on advancing a new future
for an All-Atlantic Alliance, joining together the marine research
community with policy to discuss solutions for a sustainable ocean. This
event featured the signing of the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and
Innovation Alliance Declaration, with seven partner countries (the
European Union, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Cabo Verde, Morocco, South
Africa, and the United States). In Washington, D.C. on 13 July, 2022,
the European Union, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Cabo Verde, Morocco,
South Africa, and the United States signed a new All-Atlantic Ocean
Research and Innovation Declaration. This will continue the successful
journey of ocean science diplomacy and set a common path forward for
ocean research cooperation in the Atlantic, from Pole to Pole, for the
next decade.
