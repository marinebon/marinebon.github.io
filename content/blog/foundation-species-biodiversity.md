Marine foundation species like giant kelp, seagrass, and corals, harbor
great reservoirs of biodiversity in coastal oceans. Now the Santa
Barbara Channel MBON team, supported in part by NOAA, has shown the
extent to which one of these species, giant kelp, supports coastal
ecosystems. MBON work has revealed that kelp positively affects reef
biodiversity, especially predators and sessile invertebrates that form
the base of the food web. Stability of giant kelp forests, moreover,
stabilize the community, dampening fluctuations in populations of many
other species. Long-term kelp manipulation experiments show that when
giant kelp is frequently disturbed, species that depend on it decline.
Finally, MBON work is making it possible to track fluctuations in kelp
using Landsat satellite imagery, and now drones and hyperspectral and
multispectral sensors are being used to map kelp’s health as climate
changes and nutrient regimes shift. An important MBON goal is to extend
our monitoring of key species like foundation species across the
continuity of space to better understand how coastal impacts affect
biodiversity.
