On October 12th, 2023, the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network
(MBON) and the Fresh Water Biodiversity Observation Network (FWBON)
brought together their members in a joint session at the GEO BON Global
Conference 2023 in Montreal.
With the goal of \*Monitoring Biodiversity for Action\*, this joint
session explored how biodiversity monitoring capabilities and approaches
in marine and inland waters can be aligned with terrestrial approaches
to track biodiversity change. Topics included 1) the role of thematic
biodiversity observation networks (FWBON and MBON) and existing programs
(GBIF, OBIS, etc.) in building the Global Biodiversity Observation
System (GBiOS) and measuring ecosystem services with a special focus on
food/energy/water; 2) linking the frameworks of Essential Variables
(Essential Ocean Variables, Essential Climate Variables, and Essential
Biodiversity Variables) and Biotic Condition Indicators of the SEEA
Ecosystem Accounting framework; 3) benefits and feasibility of aligning
biodiversity indicator dashboards for communicating biodiversity change
in marine and inland waters; 4) opportunities and challenges for
community-based monitoring and integration of Traditional Ecological
Knowledge in aquatic realms; and 5) priorities for further indicator
development to support national needs and international agreements such
as the Kunming-Montreal GBF, the Sustainable Development Goals, and the
UNFCCC Paris Agreement.
\*\*Highlights:\*\*
There is an urgency to synergize aquatic approaches to biodiversity
monitoring and data collection and to better connect the community
globally and across freshwater and marine domains. In fresh water,
coastal and open ocean environments, important direct drivers of
biodiversity loss (fishing, land and sea use, pollution) augment the
impacts of climate change. Measuring the extent of inland, coastal, and
marine biodiversity to characterize habitats and biodiversity is a
management priority for nations around the world. Nations are faced with
addressing the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global
Biodiversity Framework, and this requires baselines and measuring
progress against them. Yet nationally and regionally accepted protocols
for freshwater biodiversity monitoring and ecological status assessment
are rare.
Key challenges still encompass limited awareness and understanding,
restricted access to advanced technologies, capacity-building gaps, and
financial constraints.
Yet the structure provided by GEO BON to link different national and
thematic BONs helps to address requirements for biodiversity information
in the land-ocean-atmosphere continuum to address multiple societal
needs. A major effort underway is to integrate biology and ecosystems
observations with physical and biological observing systems across the
continuum. There is also progress in better coordinating across the
limnology community and wetlands observing strategies. The Global Ocean
Observing System (GOOS) provides a framework for the design and
implementation of ocean observing systems for marine life via a series
of Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs). These EOVs, spanning physical,
biogeochemical and marine life observations, provide the foundation for
the Essential Biodiversity Variables. There is a recognition that
habitats such as drainage ditches, estuaries of all sizes, and wetlands
play important roles in delivering ecosystem services and need to be
integrated into these observing frameworks. Many of these areas are
important for food, human health, and developing and managing Blue
Carbon.
New methods, such as Underwater Hyperspectral Imaging, environmental
DNA, acoustics, animal tracking and remote sensing are emerging for
assessing biodiversity and ecological status of shallow and deep aquatic
ecosystems.
