International collaboration to share capacity development to observe and
preserve data on life in the sea in compliance with ocean regulations
The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) of the Group on Earth
Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) and the
ProtectedSeas recognize the need for globally coordinated and sustained
ocean and biodiversity observing and data collection systems. Such
systems are urgently needed to systematically assess the state of the
ocean’s biodiversity including biological resources and ecosystems, and
how these will change in the future. This knowledge will provide the
basis to more effectively conserve and sustainably use marine life both
within and beyond areas of national jurisdiction.
A coordinated global ocean biodiversity observing system, especially one
that includes regulatory data, would provide the data, information and
knowledge needed to inform the progress towards, for example, the global
2030 targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (including SDG 14),
targets and indicators of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD),
and activities related to UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use
of biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.
The agreement between MBON and the ProtectedSeas recognizes ongoing
cooperation to reinforce ocean biodiversity observing capacity and use
the best available resources and expertise. By collaborating with each
other on data, biodiversity, and levels of fishing protection
interpretive needs, we can improve data and information sharing. This
will result in more robust data that can be used for evaluating and
assessing existing and future MPAs.
ProtectedSeas believes it can help accelerate the analysis to better
understand protection levels in existing marine protected areas, and
beyond. Partnering will potentially facilitate more informed marine
spatial planning needs for 30×30, and other future assessments. Virgil
Zetterlind, Director of ProtectedSeas said: “It has been our delight to
share the regulatory data we have available for 21,700 Marine Protected
Areas, in 200 countries and territories, and translated into 25
languages with MBON, as their team has been adept at amplifying this
resource among its vast network of international practitioners.”
“The MBON is excited to collaborate with ProtectedSeas to support the
international science and operations community to better understand
marine protected areas through a regulatory perspective and inform map
assessments,” says Joana Soares, Executive Secretary of MBON and Project
Officer of the AIR Centre. “Together, we can amplify awareness of the
ProtectedSeas Navigator program and the work MBON is tackling to help
find solutions to conserve coastal and marine biodiversity and ecosystem
services around the world.”
