\*Programme proposal: submitted by MBON partners to the first call for

Marine Life 2030 will establish the globally coordinated system to
deliver actionable, transdisciplinary knowledge of ocean life to those
who need it, promoting human well-being, sustainable development, and
ocean conservation. Within a decade, Marine Life 2030 will unite
existing and new programs into a global, interoperable network,
transforming the observation and forecasting of marine life. The network
of networks will be founded on frontier technologies for measuring
marine biodiversity across regions, from molecules to ecosystems,
linking the ocean’s diverse stakeholders to advance society’s grand
challenge of achieving a healthy and resilient ocean and the sustainable
society that depends on it. [Read more here.](https://marinebon.org/assets/Marine_Life_2030_UN_Ocean_Decade_request_for_endorsement_20210115.pdf)
