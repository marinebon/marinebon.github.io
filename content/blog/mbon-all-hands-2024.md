The
Marine Biodiversity Observation Network
(MBON; [https://marinebon.org/](xmlrpc.php%3Frsd.html))
hosted the annual US MBON All-Hands Workshop in New Orleans, Louisiana,
March 18-22, 2024. We are celebrating the tenth anniversary of the
implementation of the first US MBON pilot projects!
The
MBON is an open community of practice in which all can participate,
contribute, and from which all can benefit. The goal of the meeting was
to strengthen collaborations among the US MBON projects and stakeholders
in local and national government agencies. We discussed how the MBON can
identify gaps in information and human capacity, support applications
using biodiversity and ecosystem observations, and how to develop better
products for resource management. An important focus was advancing data
management strategies to support user needs. We were honored to have
participants from the US and international offices of OBIS, GBIF, and
FishBase in the meeting, in addition to participants from multiple US
Federal Government agencies, and State resource management agencies, and
the private sector.
As
part of the annual meeting, experts discussed how to advance marine
species distribution modeling (SDM) (March 21-22, 2024). The group
included the AquaX team which is advancing the historic work of
AquaMaps, data management discussions, and a conversation on possible
standards for inputs and outputs to enable ensemble SDM analysis. The
group discussed establishing a Species Distribution Model – Model
Intercomparison Project (SDM-MIP) to complement the Fisheries and Marine
Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (FISH-MIP) that is linked to the
work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and climate
MIP efforts.
MBON
continues to make significant progress through a series of Working
Groups and its leadership of the Marine Life 2030 Programme
(<https://marinelife2030.org/>)
of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, and the
close collaboration with the MBON Secretariat led from the AIR Centre in
the Azores (Portugal) and strong collaborations with the GEO BON, the
Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), OBIS, GBIF, and other partners
around the world.

The
MBON team visited the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve
located near New Orleans. The adventurous group that loves risk
(“Danger
is our business!”)
is pictured
below. We saw many alligators, a variety of birds including a very large
owl, and other local wildlife. We saw all from the safety of a swamp
boat guided by a very funny captain who assured us he would be the first
one to abandon the boat and leave us to distract the alligators, if
anything were to happen.
