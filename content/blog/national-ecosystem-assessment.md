NEA at UNEP-WCMC supports countries undertaking ecosystems
assessments.
The National Ecosystem Assessment Initiative (NEA Initiative) at
UNEP-WCMC launched a new website to support countries undertaking
ecosystem assessments. The new online platform hosts a range of
resources produced by the NEA Initiative and its partners, including
webinars, guidance documents, reports, case studies and lessons learned
seeking to present and promote the national ecosystem assessment
process.
National ecosystem assessments lay out the status and trends on
biodiversity and ecosystem services in a given country, their drivers of
change, the impacts those drivers are having now and, in the future, and
the effectiveness of interventions and responses, empowering the
consideration of the full value of nature in decision-making.
