NOAA and partner agencies, including NASA, the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, and the Office of Naval Research have awarded several new
proposals
On behalf of the
[National Oceanographic Partnership Program](https://nopp.org/),
NOAA and partner agencies, including
[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), the
[Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management](https://www.boem.gov/), and the
[Office of Naval Research](https://www.nre.navy.mil/) have awarded
several new proposals that:
1. Build upon the foundation established by the
[U.S. Marine Biodiversity Observation
Network](xmlrpc.php%3Frsd.html), the
[U.S. Animal
Telemetry Network](https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/atn/), and the
[U.S. IOOS Regional
Associations](https://ioos.noaa.gov/regions/) to work across sectors and disciplines towards an
integrated, sustained marine life observing capability for the U.S.
ocean, coasts and Great Lakes, from estuaries to the deep ocean.
2. Advance technologies for efficient and/or automated collection of
species and associated habitat observations.
3. Enable open access to biodiversity data and information.
4. Utilize these observations, technologies, and data to address
place-based (e.g., sanctuaries, reserves, protected areas, leasing
blocks, etc.) management, conservation and restoration needs.
The Principal Investigators and project titles are as follows:
\*\*Francisco Chavez, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute\*\*
\*\*The CeNCOOS MBON: Marine biodiversity information in support of a
healthy Blue Economy in the central California Current\*\*
This project will integrate remote sensing products, in situ data and
models in support of a healthy Blue Economy in the Central California
Current. Targeted users include NOAA California Current Integrated
Ecosystem Assessment, National Marine Sanctuary Programs, the Bureau of
Ocean Energy Management, and the State of California. The goal is to
quantify relationships between climate, the ocean environment (physics,
chemistry) and marine food webs (from microbes to fish and top
predators), with the aim of providing predictive understanding of marine
ecosystem responses to environmental change.
\*\*Nathan Furey, University of New Hampshire\*\*
\*\*Quantifying marine biodiversity through movements and feeding:
Assessing\*\* \*\*coastal marine ecosystem dynamics near estuary mouths\*\*
This project will integrate powerful technologies (acoustic telemetry,
environmental DNA \[eDNA\], and acoustics) with traditional fisheries
sampling to quantify impacts of changes in local and regional water
conditions on individuals, populations, and community structure. The
team will study the impacts of forage species and environmental
conditions on Atlantic cod and common terns in both New Hampshire and
southern Maine (Casco Bay) coastal waters.
\*\*Cassandra Glaspie, Louisiana State University\*\*
\*\*Louisiana Deltaic Estuaries MBON: Sea Level Rise Sentinels\*\*
Estuarine ecosystems are highly productive and diverse environments that
provide essential ecosystem function and services. This project will
establish a new Marine Biodiversity Observing Network effort in coastal
Louisiana, focusing on highly productive and diverse estuarine
ecosystems as sea level rise sentinels.
\*\*Katrin Iken, University of Alaska Fairbanks\*\*
\*\*AMBON (Arctic MBON) – linking biodiversity observations in the
Arctic\*\*
The Arctic Marine Biodiversity Observing Network is designed to provide
high-quality biodiversity data from the Arctic Chukchi Sea across
trophic levels, from microbes to whales. This project will continue
efforts to collect biodiversity data across trophic levels and in
relation to environmental conditions; to use biodiversity data to detect
changes in species composition, including invasive species; and
determine effective in situ observing designs through modeling.
\*\*Frank Muller-Karger, University of South Florida\*\*
\*\*The Southeast US Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON):
Toward Operational\*\* \*\*Marine Life Data for Conservation and
Sustainability\*\*
This project will serve as a regional collaboration hub of U.S. IOOS to
address needs for marine biodiversity information in the Gulf of Mexico
and Southeast U.S. EEZ. The effort focuses on the needs of resource
managers of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and other federal
and state jurisdictions spanning Biscayne Bay, the Florida Keys, the
West Florida Shelf, and deep corals.
