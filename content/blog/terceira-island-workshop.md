\*\*Workshop: Enhancing marine biodiversity data collection and
publishing\*\*
\*\*Date:\*\* 10 – 14 November 2025
\*\*Location:\*\* Terceira Island, Azores, Portugal.
\*\*Instructors:\*\* Carolina Peralta, Tylar Murray, Nuno Álvaro, Jacqueline
Dearborn 
The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network
([MBON](xmlrpc.php%3Frsd.html)) and the [AIR
Centre](https://www.aircentre.org/) will host a small, hands-on,
interactive workshop focused on mobilising marine biological observation
datasets to the Ocean Biodiversity Information System
([OBIS](https://obis.org/)). The objective is to help data holders
understand the value of following good practices for standardising
biological data, using widely accepted biodiversity standards like
Darwin Core. This would include records of different biological
attributes and ecosystem observations from different types of sampling
methodologies. A complementary activity of the workshop will contemplate
a field workday in which participants will receive training on the
collection and processing of benthic photo-quadrat imagery and their
analysis following MBON Pole to Pole monitoring protocols, aiming to
enhance capacity for long-term monitoring of rocky intertidal
communities. 
By the end of the workshop, attendees will have a clear understanding of
the process of mobilising biological data to OBIS and will have brought
one of their datasets to a final maturity state that aligns with best
practices for data sharing and biodiversity documentation. The workshop
will also enhance awareness of improving the quality of marine
biodiversity data and will increase the availability of marine
biological data for scientific research, species conservation, and
ecosystem-based management by promoting data publication through OBIS.
Additionally, the workshop will foster collaborative research efforts
among participants and contribute to the MBON community of practice by
increasing capacity in the implementation of coordinated and
standardised biodiversity observing and publishing efforts.
