**MBON Relevance to CHOW 2020**

MBON is a growing global initiative composed of regional networks of scientists, resource managers, and end-users integrating historical and current biology and ecosystem surveys with new observations, and expanding application of remote sensing methods, novel molecular (eDNA) technologies, artificial intelligence and other innovative approaches with traditional environmental research tools and coordinated experiments to support our understanding of impacts from a changing environment on marine and human life.

MBON works to standardize methods and best practices to quantify relationships between climate, the ocean environment and marine food webs, from microbes to top predators, to provide predictive understanding of marine ecosystem responses to environmental change. We work in partnership with the [Global Ocean Observing System](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=79&Itemid=273) GOOS, the [Ocean Biodiversity Information System](https://obis.org) (OBIS), the [Ocean Best Practices System](https://www.oceanbestpractices.org), the [Group on Earth Observations (GEO)](https://geobon.org/bons/thematic-bon/mbon/), and a broad suite of US and global partners to advance science, best practices, and coordinated monitoring in support of national and international biodiversity and ecosystem health assessments, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Â Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the International (UN) Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030 and other initiatives.
