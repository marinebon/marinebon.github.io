The Asia-Pacific BON has been working on the identification of threats
to biodiversity, in particular, drivers of biodiversity loss, mangrove
loss, wetland loss, and anthropogenic actions that hamper the
achievement of Sustainable Development Goals.

The Asia Pacific BON, or AP-BON, was organized by the participants of
the International Workshop for Networking Biodiversity Observation
Activities in Asia Pacific Region held from July 21-22 2009, in Nagoya
University, Japan. It was established as a regional network related to
GEO BON, covering most countries of the Asia-Pacific region and covering
all levels of biodiversity and ecosystems. As of 2017, some BONs are
already operational at the national and sub-regional levels but there
remains a need to organize more National BONs and organize their
network, with the support of the GEO BON Secretariat and BON Development
Working Group. Training courses were organized and are available through
GBIF as funded by BIFA. There is however still a need to expand to other
areas and parts of Asia and Pacific.

The AP BON has been working on the identification of threats to
biodiversity, in particular, drivers of biodiversity loss, mangrove
loss, wetland loss, and anthropogenic actions that hamper the
achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. The AP BON makes the use
of various technology for biodiversity monitoring at high resolution and
providing large coverage such as Forest Crane, Drones and LIDAR that
facilitate assessments in various ecosystems. Biodiversity databases
have been established through various accessible platforms such as GBIF,
ABCDNET, National Clearing House Mechanisms and the ASEAN Clearing House
Mechanisms. In addition, related databases specific to certain taxa have
been established.
