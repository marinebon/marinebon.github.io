## About \*\*MBON\*\*

The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) is a thematic node of
the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO
BON).
MBON is a global collaborative initiative that contributes to the
effective management of marine biodiversity and ecosystem services.

## Mission

Foster and coordinate a global community of practice for collecting,
curating, analyzing, good management, and communicating marine
biodiversity data and related services to the scientific community,
policymakers, the public, and other stakeholders.

## Vision

MBON envisions that observations of marine biodiversity, from local to
global scales, become an integral part of observing systems to
strengthen the understanding of marine biodiversity and monitoring of
associated changes over time, to inform society for sustainable
development and conservation priorities.

## Goals:
- Develop a common framework for high
priority observations in the context of Essential Ocean
Variables;
- Promote best practice (OBPs) in
observations, data management, and applications to advance
interoperability and data integration (DarwinCore), and publication of
data in open-access databases (OBIS);
- Promote the publication of
observations and development of products that inform policies, ocean
uses, and research;
- Facilitate capacity building;
- Serve and work with the ocean
science community and resource management practitioners to achieve
their goals, expand their international contacts, and support the
implementation of biodiversity observations to address local societal
needs;
- Coordinate membership through
networking, communication efforts, and other facilitation
services;
- Foster the development of
international and thematic networks within MBON;
- Develop marine biodiversity
observing and applications strategies that are coordinated and
consistent with fresh water and terrestrial ecologists.

## Guiding Principles:
###### MBON agenda is aligned with key international agreements and guidelines for evaluating changes in ocean biodiversity for sustainable development:- The United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development;
- UN Decade of Ocean Science for
Sustainable Development;
- Convention on Biological Diversity
(CBD);
- Intergovernmental Platform on
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) global assessments;
- GEO BON;
- Intergovernmental Oceanographic
Commission (IOC).
