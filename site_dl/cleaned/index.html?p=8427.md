The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) calls on nations,
scientists, sponsors, and stakeholders to work together as a community
of practice to support Marine Life 2030 to enable a dialogue, and
coordination and cooperation between programs. Please see this [Dear
Colleague Letter](storage/2022/11/Dear-Colleague-Letter.pdf) and join
the MBON/Marine Life 2030 Community of Practice.

### Benefits of MBON

- Participate in a network for the
collection of biological and environmental data that are openly shared
to inform scientists, resource managers, educators, and all
stakeholders about the state of marine biodiversity and how it is
changing;
- Serve and work with the ocean
science community and resource management practitioners to achieve
their goals, expand their international contacts, and support the
implementation of biodiversity observing to address local societal
needs; 
- Optimize the costs of data
management and improve access to information on marine biodiversity
and ecosystem health;
- Participate in actions and other
activities related to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable
Development (2021-2030) and the UN Decade for Ecosystem Restoration
(2021-2030).

- Contribute to best practices and
mechanisms to share data, experiences, knowledge, and protocols to
understand species and the status and trends of ecosystem
services;
- Contribute to increasing our
understanding of physical and biological connectivity, including
distributions and movements of species across biogeographical regions
and political jurisdictions;
- Help build a framework for a region
or a country to evaluate the status and identify trends in
biodiversity and living marine resources;
- Expand our knowledge of biodiversity
and its connection to ecosystem services to improve the management of
human activities that impact these services and promote sustainable
use of such services;
