The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) of the Group on Earth
Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), the Scientific
Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), and the SCAR Antarctic
Biodiversity Portal share a common vision on the building and
coordination of a global ocean biodiversity observation system. The
common goal is to systematically assess the state and trends in the
ocean’s biodiversity, including biological resources and ecosystems and
how these will change in the future.
This observing system will provide the data, information and knowledge
that people need to effectively conserve and sustainably use marine
life. The Southern Ocean, the ocean basin around the Antarctic
continent, and all ocean water beyond Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ)
represent such a “commons” to humanity. Minding these waters from the
surface to the abyss, and especially life in these areas, will inform
progress towards safeguarding the environment and protecting the
integrity of the ecosystem of the seas surrounding Antarctica as outline
in the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
resources (CCAMLR), the global 2030 targets of the UN Sustainable
Development Goals (including SDG 14) and the UN Ocean Decade, and the
new 2050 targets and indicators of the Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD).
The agreement between MBON, SCAR, and the SCAR Antarctic Biodiversity
Portal recognizes an ongoing cooperation to reinforce ocean biodiversity
observing capacity, and to make use of the best available resources and
expertise. The entities agree to collaborate respecting the principles
of reciprocity, mutual benefit and results sharing, as well as to
strengthen the exchange of ideas and integration with global marine data
initiatives such as the Global Ocean Observation System (GOOS), the
Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), the Ocean Best Practices
System (OBPS), Marine Life 2030, and others.

![](media/storage/2022/03/mbon.png)The Marine Biodiversity
Observation Network (MBON) is the key biodiversity pillar of the Group
on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) for the
marine realm. The MBON is a community of practice that facilitates the
coordination of individual monitoring programs and existing networks
focused on local, regional, and thematic aspects of marine biology and
biodiversity, to improve standards and best practices in the collection,
management, and publication of marine biodiversity data and the status
and trends of ecosystems and their services.
 
![](media/storage/2022/03/scar.png)The Scientific Committee on
Antarctic Research ([SCAR](https://www.scar.org/)) is a thematic
organisation of the [International Science Council
(ISC)](https://council.science/), and was created in 1958. SCAR is
charged with initiating, developing and coordinating high quality
international scientific research in the Antarctic region (including the
Southern Ocean), and on the role of the Antarctic region in the Earth
system. SCAR provides objective and independent scientific advice to
the [Antarctic Treaty System](https://www.ats.aq/index\_e.html) and other
organizations such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
on issues of science and conservation affecting the management of
Antarctica and the Southern Ocean and on the role of the Antarctic
region in the Earth system.
 
![](media/storage/2022/03/biodi.png)The Antarctic Biodiversity
Portal ([biodiversity.aq](https://www.biodiversity.aq/)) is an
international effort of SCAR. It finds it roots in the Census of
Antarctic Marine Life and started in 2005. It seeks to increase our
knowledge and understanding of Antarctic and Southern Ocean
biodiversity. The SCAR Antarctic Biodiversity Portal is the regional
thematic node of the Ocean Biogeographic Information System
([OBIS](http://www.obis.org/)), the Global Biodiversity Information
Facility ([GBIF](http://www.gbif.org/)) and works closely together with
the Southern Ocean Observation System ([SOOS](http://www.soos.aq/)). It
provides support to publish Southern Ocean biodiversity data and to
improve standards and best practices in the collection, management, and
publication of marine biodiversity data.
