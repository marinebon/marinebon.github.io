BioTrack is a collaborative project to assess and monitor biodiversity
hotspots where marine species share habitat. By integrating satellite
and acoustic tracking of marine animals with remotely sensed
environmental data, and modeling techniques, BioTrack aims to map these
biodiversity hotspots and their intersections with areas of human use
and interest, such as marine sanctuaries and wind energy leasing blocks.
Additionally, the project will examine the impact of future
environmental variation on these hotspots and its spatial intersections
of human use. Emphasizing stakeholder engagement from the start, the
project is designed to produce practical, accessible data products to
aid in informed decision-making and support conservation and management
efforts.

tracks in the DAC from the South Florida/Gulf of Mexico region.

Knowledge about marine species hotspots and how they are changing will
provide opportunities for prioritizing spatial protections, planning for
multiple use of ocean spaces, and monitoring for ecosystem responses to
environmental change.
The data will be made available in an interactive portal available to
the public within shared areas of the websites of the Marine
Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) and the Animal Tracking Network
(ATN).
Currently the effort focuses on the Western North Atlantic, Gulf of
Mexico, and Caribbean Sea, with a plan to scale the framework to other
regions.

\*\*Frequently Asked Questions\*\*
\*Q: What are the specific project objectives?\*
A: Specific objectives include:
1. Identify and predict the location and timing of biodiversity
‘hotspots’ of marine species
2. Characterize the environmental conditions underlying these hotspots.
3. Map hotspots with management areas and maritime jurisdictions to
determine level of overlap with ocean uses, to develop conservation
options, and increase the efficiency of fisheries by reducing
bycatch
4. Monitor and model if and how these biodiversity hotspots change over
time and space in response to changing environmental conditions
\*Q: What is the end products and project deliverables?\*
A: There are several product and deliverables that we hope will come
from BioTrack:
1. Multi-author scientific papers. Data contributors will be
co-authors.
2. Data summary visualizations and infographics that will be supplied
to management bodies to aid in assessments
3. Stronger linkages between MBON and the ATN
\*Q: What are the benefits to collaborating?\*
A: Benefits to collaborators include:
1. Assistance with tracking data management
2. Archiving of tracking data
3. Fulfilling broader impact outreach: data summary visualization and
infographics will be accessible to the public from the MBON website
4. Co-authorship in publications
5. Application of data as a management tool
6. Building collaborative networks and supporting graduate student
research
\*Q: What data are you looking for?\*
A: We are looking for acoustic and satellite tagging data from past or
current projects. Information needed includes species, deployment
location and dates.
\*Q: What species are you looking for?\*
A: We are looking for any marine species that have been acoustic or
satellite tagged (marine mammals, seabirds, teleosts, sharks, reptiles)
\*Q: Who will have access to my data?\*
A: Raw data will be protected to the extent desired by the contributor.
If you join this collaboration, you will be the PI for your specific
project. Access to the raw data will be granted to the leads of this
effort to help coordinate and support joint data analyses and
collaboration between all participants. PIs will only have access to
their assigned projects and no raw data from any other BioTrack
contributors will be shared unless permitted by the contributor.
\*Q: How is my data protected?\*
A: Please see the [data management
plan](storage/2022/07/biotrack\_datamanagementplan.pdf) for more
information.
\*Q: Will my data become public?\*
A: Data will be aggregated and synthesized into products, which will be
made available through the ATN portal as well as the final BioTrack
project housed on the MBON website. Not all data from all contributing
researchers will have to be released at the same time, and we will work
with PIs to release data at a time that works for them and their needs,
since they will likely want to publish stand-alone manuscripts.
\*Q: Will this preclude me from publishing my data separately?\*
A: Not at all. Individual data contributors are free to use their data
in any way. Collaboration in BioTrack does not prevent or preclude
contributors from using their data in any other research projects or
papers.
\*Q: What is the timeline for this project?\*
A: As this is a large scale project with many collaborators, we predict
this to progress over the next few years. Updates will be shared as they
arise.
\*Q: How do I become a collaborator?\*
A: To join this collaborative initiative, please contact [Neil
