The MBON announces new partnership with Seabed2030 and Marine Life 2030
to share the capacity to map the seabed and observe marine
life
![](media/storage/2023/07/mbon-seabed.png)A new partnership has been announced between the Marine
Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON), Marine Life 2030 and the Nippon
Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project. The memorandum of understanding
signed by the parties outlines their commitment to advancing the field
of ocean exploration, with a particular focus on the observation of
marine life.
The MBON and two programmes endorsed by the UN Decade of Ocean Science
for Sustainable Development: Marine Life 2030 and Seabed 2030,
(sponsored by the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO) recognize the need for
globally coordinated and sustained ocean mapping and biodiversity
observing. Such integrated mapping is needed to systematically assess
the state of the ocean, including marine life and ecosystems, and to
detect change as the ocean changes. This knowledge will provide the
basis to more effectively conserve and sustainably use marine life both
within and beyond areas of national jurisdiction.
The agreement signed between MBON, Marine Life 2030, and Seabed 2030
recognizes the need for cooperation to map both the bathymetry and
biodiversity of the global ocean, collaborating with different
stakeholders, building their capacity and providing them with the best
available resources and expertise. Through collaboration, these
international networks, will advance understanding and contribute to the
UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.
“\*It’s a pleasure to welcome MBON and Marine Life 2030 to Seabed 2030’s
valued network of partners\*,” commented Seabed 2030 Project Director
Jamie McMichael-Phillips. “\*The essential work of these organisations
helps empower the world to make informed policy decisions on marine
biodiversity and ocean sustainability\*.”
\*“MBON and Marine Life 2030 are excited to collaborate with Seabed 2030.
We need such global networks to bring different people together to work
on difficult questions like where marine life exists and how and why it
is changing. The knowledge will help manage when, where, and how we can
use ocean resources in a way that conserves the amazing diversity of
marine life, for the joy and benefit of our own and future
generations”\*, says Frank Muller-Karger, MBON co-chair and Marine Life
2030 co-lead.\*\* \*\*

\*\*The Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project\*\* is a collaborative
project between The Nippon Foundation and GEBCO. The Seabed 2030
Project, launched at the United Nations Ocean Conference in 2017 by
Chairman Sasakawa of The Nippon Foundation, coordinates and oversees the
sourcing and compilation of bathymetric data from different parts of the
world’s ocean through its five centres into the freely-available GEBCO
Grid. Four Regional Centres cover the Southern Ocean, the Arctic and
North Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and the South and
West Pacific Ocean. These feed data products into the Global Data
Centre. The IHO Data Center for Digital Bathymetry (DCDB) serves as
the long-term archive for Seabed 2030.
\*\*The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON)\*\* is a thematic
node of the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network
(GEO BON). It facilitates networking amongst the marine biodiversity
community to improve standards and best practices in the collection,
management, and open publication of marine biodiversity data. The MBON
coordinates the community of practice for the Marine Life 2030 Programme
endorsed by the Ocean Decade. \*\*Marine Life 2030\*\* helps to network
different partners to achieve the goals of the UN Ocean Decade,
especially those relevant to marine life and life in general.
