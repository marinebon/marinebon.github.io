Over 2.15 billion people live close to
the coast, with 898 million in low-lying areas. For these communities,
the sea is central to their lives, work, culture, emotions and
spirituality. 
Children and youth are the demographic
group that will be the most affected by climate change. Yet, they are
often left out of environmental discussions at the international
level.
Somos OceanoS, a
[Marine Life
2030](https://marinelife2030.org/)-affiliated project,
wants to change this. They are excited to invite you to be a part of a
global dialogue between youth and decision-makers in marine conservation
through their \*\*Letters to the
Sea\*\* initiative providing a unique
glimpse into the \*\*youth´s perspective, voicing their challenges,
ambitions and needs.\*\* \*\*Their
goal is to collect 1,000,000 letters for an art exhibition at the 2025
