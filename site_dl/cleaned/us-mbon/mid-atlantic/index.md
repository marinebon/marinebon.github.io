## \*\*Mid-Atlantic\*\* MBON

The Mid-Atlantic MBON project integrates cutting edge biological
information with ocean observations to develop new data products,
analytical tools, and information resources supporting ocean and coastal
management.
The project will provide dynamic biodiversity information at timescales
relevant for fisheries management, offshore energy, and other
stakeholders to support jobs, the economy, safety and well-being for the
more than 78 million people living, visiting, and working in the
Mid-Atlantic Bight.

The U.S. Mid-Atlantic coast is a region of dynamic change, with
pronounced seasonal variation in biodiversity driven by temperature and
oceanographic processes, powerful storms, and infrastructure
development. Iconic endangered species such as North Atlantic right
whales and Atlantic sturgeon and important fishery species such as
striped bass and coastal sharks undergo long-distance annual migrations
through the region. Other commercially important species such as
Atlantic sea scallops and black sea bass are long-term residents
dependent on unique oceanographic features like the U.S. Mid-Atlantic
Bight Cold Pool. The project will increase our understanding of patterns
and changes in biodiversity and advance the transition from intermittent
vessel-based observations and sampling to coordinated, co-located
observations and models on a monthly- to daily-scale, which are needed
by decision-makers.
The project will create a regionally unique archive of co-located
biological data (from environmental DNA \[eDNA\], animal telemetry, and
passive acoustic monitoring) and oceanographic data (high frequency
\[HF\] radar, gliders, satellites, models). Regional models and
information tools derived from these data will be co-developed with
diverse stakeholders to inform future monitoring efforts for stock and
ecosystem assessments, place-based management (e.g., fisheries
management, offshore energy leasing and permitting, marine sanctuary
planning), and other regional efforts. Novel open access datasets (e.g.,
HF radar climatologies, biodiversity hotspot and species distribution
models) will be made available through the MBON Portal, MARACOOS
OceansMap, Atlantic Cooperative Telemetry Network, OBIS, NCEI and other
relevant platforms. Education materials will be developed and
distributed via the Smithsonian Institution’s Ocean Portal and other
partner activities.
The U.S. Mid-Atlantic MBON is co-led by MARACOOS and the Smithsonian
Environmental Research Center. Collaborating institutions include Blue
Wave Consulting Group, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics
Laboratory, the National Museum of Natural History, RPS (a TetraTech
Company), Rutgers University, University of Delaware, and University of
Maryland Center for Environmental Science. The project features the
demonstration of an integrated biodiversity and telemetry observation
program in the location of the Maryland Wind Energy Lease Area,
leveraging an ongoing monitoring program supported by U.S. Wind, Inc.
