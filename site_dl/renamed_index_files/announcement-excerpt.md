We
are excited to
share that
the [United
Nations Ocean
Decade ](https://oceandecade.org/)Vision
2030 White Papers have been officially published.
Structured
around the 10 Ocean Decade Challenges, the
[Vision
2030](https://oceandecade.org/news/vision-2030-ocean-decade-launches-new-global-ambition-setting-process/)
process
aimed
to set a tailored and specific strategic ambition, and associated
milestones, for each of the Challenges,
ensuring
their road to success by 2030.
A key
outcome of the Vision 2030 process, the 10 White papers represent a
collaborative effort to develop the science we need for the ocean we
want. 
Over the past year, a
team of 20 co-chairs and more than 150 experts have diligently worked to
assess user needs, prioritize key datasets, and identify gaps in
scientific knowledge. The comprehensive documents were reviewed by the
global community and recently presented at the Ocean Decade Conference
held in Barcelona in April 2024. This event provided a unique platform
for stakeholders to engage, share insights, and collaboratively advance
the implementation of these crucial papers.
The MBON, Marine Life
2030, and several others have long focused on building a global
community to address Challenge 2 “Protect and Restore Ecosystems and
Biodiversity” of the Ocean Decade. The strategic ambition outlined in
the Vision 2030 white paper about Challenge 2 is “to enable
ecosystem-based management approaches using timely and accurate
information to promote sustainable development. This includes, but is
not limited to, the effective conservation and restoration of ecosystems
and biodiversity.”
We
are grateful to Challenge 2 White Paper co-chairs, Frank Muller-Karger
and Aileen Tan, for their hard work, and expertise in this process and
for leading the Working Group authoring this document. We welcome the
science, private, education, and government sectors to enable the Vision
2030 strategic ambition. MBON and Marine Life 2030 offer a network to
help advance this dialogue.
