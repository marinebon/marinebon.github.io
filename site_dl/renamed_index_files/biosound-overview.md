## Overview

The BioSound working group is composed
of various scientists and stakeholders interested in producing
acoustic-based data products that support marine biodiversity monitoring
and conservation. BioSound is particularly interested in understanding
the value of underwater soundscape metrics as indicators of biological
and anthropogenic change in the context of biodiversity conservation.
BioSound was formed as an initiative of the Marine Biodiversity
Observation Network.

## Goals and Objectives

The goals of the BioSound working group include:
- As a collaborative group, establish common practices, analytical
recommendations, and data standards as it pertains to underwater
soundscapes for the purpose of biodiversity monitoring and
conservation.
- Provide a collaborative space for individuals and organizations
working with bioacoustic soundscape data to share methods and ideas
and participate in coordinated research efforts.
We seek to achieve these goals through the following objectives:
- Produce comparable acoustic data products from NOAA IOOS regional
networks (e.g. SECOORA), MBON, and MBON-related regions that are
informative of Biodiversity and ecosystem/habitat changes.
- Advance the language and applications of Essential Ocean Variables,
including the Ocean Sound EOV.
- Assess multiple datasets in variable ocean and coastal environments to
establish or identify soundscape metric standards and create
meaningful data products from validated soundscape metrics.
- Obtain consensus on data storing and metadata practices from those
involved in this effort and share this approach with the broader
acoustic community.
- Determine capabilities and limitations of soundscape variables in
biodiversity and ecosystem/habitat monitoring.
- Provide resources for those wanting to incorporate soundscape
analytical methods in their own research/project efforts.c
- Describe benefits of standardized practices and the need to contribute
observations to recommended data storage and distribution
repositories.
- Collaboratively participate in grant opportunities and publications.
We envision this effort will assist in the efficient assessment of
passive acoustic datasets for temporal trends of biological sounds as
represented in the \*\*Figure 1\*\* dataset collected in a South Carolina
estuary.

## BioSound Products

[Data
Explorer of Acoustic-Based Marine Biodiversity Indices](https://ocean-science-analytics.shinyapps.io/biosound-mbon/): This product
is the result of an exploratory analysis evaluating trends in soundscape
biodiversity metrics across different ocean environments. This dashboard
provides a series of interactive figures for assessing these
acoustic-based biodiversity indices.

## FAQs

\*\*\*Q: Who is leading this project?\*\*\*
A: This is collaborative initiative,
which includes the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) of the
Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS, and element of the Global Ocean
Observing System). The project leads are Liz Ferguson (Ocean Science
Analytics) and Dr. Neil Hammerschlag (Shark Research Foundation Inc.).
The core group of participants also includes Eric Montie (University of
South Carolina Beaufort), Kate Stafford (Oregon State University), and
Jennifer Dorton (Southeast Coastal Ocean Observing Regional
Association).
\*\*\*Q: What are the end products and project deliverables?\*\*\*
A: Data products from regional
ocean and coastal environments that are related to biological sounds
and/or habitat characteristics. For example, see
our [Data
Explorer of Acoustic-Based Marine Biodiversity indices](https://ocean-science-analytics.shinyapps.io/biosound-mbon/)
\*\*\*Q: What is required for participation in this working group?\*\*\*
A: We do not have stringent
requirements, however those with passive acoustic data are asked to
contribute to initial or subsequent analysis efforts. If participants do
not have data they can contribute, then a background in bioacoustics or
marine biodiversity as it relates to sound is most useful in the context
of our goals.
\*\*\*Q: What is the timeline for this project?\*\*\*
A: As this is a large-scale project with
many collaborators, we predict this to progress over the next few years.
In the initial analysis our aim is to produce a publication based on
results by the end of 2023. Additional updates regarding the progress of
the group will be shared as they arise.
\*\*\*Q: How do I become a collaborator?\*\*\*
A: To join this collaborative
initiative, please contact working group co-lead Dr. Neil Hammerschlag
