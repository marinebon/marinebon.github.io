## \*\*Coastal New England\*\* MBON

The Coastal New England project integrates powerful technologies
(acoustic telemetry, environmental DNA \[eDNA\], and acoustics) with
traditional fisheries sampling to quantify impacts of changes in local
and regional water conditions on individuals, populations, and community
structure.
Research includes study of the impacts of forage species and
environmental conditions on Atlantic cod and common terns in both New
Hampshire (Isles of Shoals) and southern Maine (Casco Bay) coastal
waters.

To study the movements of these predators, tracking tags (GPS technology
for terns, acoustic technology for Atlantic cod) are used to follow
their movements. We will also examine their diet, by analyzing gut
contents from Atlantic cod (both visually and via genomic methods) and
terns (via genomics of fecal samples). The availability of forage
species (including river herring, Atlantic herring, and squid) can be
quantified through tracking, active acoustics, passive acoustics, and
eDNA of water samples. Information on animal movements and diet can be
integrated with a variety of environmental conditions from oceanographic
buoys, other sensors, and ocean simulation models. Mathematical models
are used to predict how changes in water temperature and diet will
affect Atlantic cod and terns. Comparing and contrasting species’
responses to environmental change helps determine the “winners and
losers” of climate change. All efforts each year are informed by a
variety of stakeholders representing resource managers and non-profit
organizations. The Coastal New England team also includes experts in
data management and accessibility to ensure data are accessible in a
timely manner.

Collectively, these results demonstrate the value in novel technologies
in tracking shifts in biodiversity across space and time. This project’s
efforts build on the known strengths of each method (eDNA, diet
analyses, active acoustics, and passive acoustics) while also exploring
their integration and defining scales of appropriate use. Definitions of
how each method describes marine biodiversity in both unique but also
shared ways are explored. This knowledge allows stakeholders to
integrate these methods into their own efforts, aiding research and
monitoring. Marine ecosystems are dynamic, and this project’s approach
determines at which scales ecosystem components change, and which
methods best detect such variation. Broadly, results demonstrate the
relative importance of environmental conditions and food availability on
marine communities to promote proper conservation and management in a
rapidly changing Gulf of Maine. The project engages a variety of
stakeholders, including New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, National
Marine Fisheries Service, Maine Department of Marine Resources, National
Audubon Society, and the Piscataqua Region Estuarine Partnership.
