will spearhead coordination of active monitoring of marine biodiversity
by organisations in Europe.

Long term time series are essential to recognise and understand trends
that may be due to natural or human activities, especially climate
change. [MBON
Europe](https://euromarinenetwork.eu/activities/mbon-europe/) will
formalise coordination between organisations through Memoranda of
Understanding (MoU), collate information on what monitoring is being
done and how, discuss how to harmonise methods, facilitate data
publication, synthesise the current situation, and develop a strategy
for improved coordination.
This LTSWG is open to new members interested in the topic. To become a
member contact: Mark John Costello at .
