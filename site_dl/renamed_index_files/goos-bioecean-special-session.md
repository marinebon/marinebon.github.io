The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), the BioEcoOcean EU-project,
the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) and the Atlantic
International Research Centre (AIR Centre) are organising a special
webinar series focusing on the Biology and Ecosystems Essential Ocean
Variables (BioEco EOVs) – the minimum set of variables needed to assess
the state of the ocean and its biodiversity.
This series brings together experts to share knowledge and discuss
innovative approaches for biodiversity monitoring and the importance of
having coordinated and standardized data collection and management. The
sessions will provide an introduction to the BioEco EOVs, their
importance for monitoring biodiversity, enabling ecological forecasting,
and supporting science, management and decision making.  
In collaboration, the webinars will be hosted by the Marine Biodiversity
Networking Fridays and GOOS, running from July to December of 2025.
Registrations will open in advance of each webinar.
