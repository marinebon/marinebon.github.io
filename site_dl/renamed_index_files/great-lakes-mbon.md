## \*\*Great Lakes\*\* MBON

This project will fill a critical gap in science and management of the
Great Lakes by creating a BON that uses complementary technological
approaches to address interconnections among dynamic pelagic habitats
known as “Lakescapes”, biodiversity across the tree of life, movement of
key fisheries species, and the role of diversity in supporting ecosystem
functions.
Partners for GL-MBON include NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research
Laboratory, Great Lakes Observing System (regional IOOS association),
Great Lakes CoastWatch node, NOAA National Marine Sanctuaries, Great
Lakes Acoustic Telemetry Observation System, Oregon State University,
and the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research.

Ecosystem services and biodiversity in the Great Lakes are imperiled by
multiple stressors including introduction of non-native species,
eutrophication, climate change, and overexploitation of fisheries.
Monitoring biodiversity in the Great Lakes is challenging due to their
spatial extent and strong gradients that lead to patchy biogeochemical
and ecological features. This project will deliver dynamic lakescape
classification using satellite-derived variables that are specific to
Great Lakes environmental dynamics. We will synthesize existing genomics
databases and collect new eDNA data (metabarcoding and metagenomics) to
assess diversity at different levels of biological organization. Fish
movement data from GLATOS will be combined with lakescapes and
environmental data to examine how those populations associate with
pelagic habitats and respond to multiple stressors. We will quantify the
link between biodiversity and function using data from ongoing
monitoring programs estimates of taxonomic and functional richness from
omics technologies. And last, we will engage an End-User Advisory Group
to produce products through co-design and meet the needs of partners and
regional stakeholders.
