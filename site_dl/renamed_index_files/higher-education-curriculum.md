The Marine Biodiversity Observation
Network
([MBON](xmlrpc.php%3Frsd.html)),
the Atlantic International Research Centre
([AIR Centre](https://www.aircentre.org/)),
and the World Maritime University-Sasakawa Global Ocean Institute
([WMU](https://www.wmu.se/goi))
have joined forces to develop a higher-education curriculum on
Ocean-Biodiversity Observing and Capacity Development (OBCaD). The
primary aim is to develop a curriculum focused on interoperable ocean
data and information management to be integrated into universities and
other institutes.
Importantly, this initiative is closely
aligned with the objectives of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for
Sustainable Development, which emphasizes the urgent need for a globally
accessible, reliable, and integrated ocean data and information
ecosystem. Through the creation of a strong and effective curriculum, we
aim to support the Decade’s key priorities—enhancing the accessibility
and usability of ocean data, fostering confidence in shared information,
and promoting digital innovations for sustainable ocean
governance.
A diverse group of national and
international experts has come together to form a strong consortium
dedicated to advancing this mission. Specialized Working Groups will
design a thorough, 10-topic curriculum centered on Marine Biodiversity
and Data Management, which will function both as a self-paced course and
as a resource to be included in live teaching.
