Over 30 regional experts in zooplankton oceanography and North Atlantic
right whale (NARW) management met virtually over four days in September
to coordinate Canadian and U.S. approaches to understanding NARW
foraging habitat and applications to NARW conservation strategies. The
population of NARW, now at approximately 400 individuals, has been
declining since 2010 and their foraging habitat has been shifting from
the Gulf of Maine in summer/fall to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The causes
for this decline are associated with a decline in abundance and shift in
distribution of the planktonic copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, the
principal prey of the NARW and an increase in mortality due to ship
strikes and fishing gear entanglement as the NARW move to new foraging
areas.
There is a need to include the best knowledge about present and future
patterns of C. finmarchicus abundance into NARW foraging habitat models
used to inform U.S. and Canadian regulations and guidance to the
shipping and fishing industries. The workshop provided an opportunity
for exchange of information about NARW management, zooplankton data
sharing, and zooplankton modeling approaches. An important outcome of
the workshop was the creation of cross-border working groups to
coordinate data sharing and deliver products useful to NARW conservation
measures. A third working group was formed to identify and coordinate
research on the causes of NARW foraging habitat change, for which there
is strong evidence that climate drivers have resulted in warming and
shifts in currents supplying water into the Gulf of Maine, affecting
zooplankton abundance and distribution. For further information, please
