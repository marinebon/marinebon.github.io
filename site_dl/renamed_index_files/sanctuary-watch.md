## Web-Enabled Information for Sanctuary Management

[![sanctuaries logo](media/storage/2023/01/sanctuary-watch-150x150.png)](https://sanctuarywatch.ioos.us)Easy access to
information for tracking ecosystem conditions, human connections and
management impacts are critical to timely, effective and community-based
resource management. Through an exciting collaboration that leverages
expertise across NOAA’s IOOS Program (including the Marine Biodiversity
Observation Network), Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) Program,
National Centers for Coast and Ocean Science (NCCOS) and the Office of
National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS), we are developing [web-based,
interactive tools](https://sanctuarywatch.ioos.us) to track and better
understand the changing nature of sanctuary ecosystems. These
user-friendly tools bring ecosystem tracking and assessment information
to the fingertips of resource managers, scientists, educators, and the
public.

## Partners

This tool is the product of on-going collaboration across NOAA’s
[Integrated Ecosystem Assessment
Program](https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov), [Integrated Ocean Observing System](https://ioos.noaa.gov/), including the
[Marine
Biodiversity Observation Network](index.html%3Fp=8803.html), and
[Office of National Marine Sanctuaries](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov).
