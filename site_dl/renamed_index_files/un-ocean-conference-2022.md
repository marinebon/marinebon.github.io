#### Scaling up Ocean Action Based on Science and Innovation for the Implementation of Goal 14: Stocktaking, Partnerships and Solutions 
The Ocean Conference, co-hosted by the Governments of Kenya and
Portugal, comes at a critical time as the world is seeking to address
the many of the deep-rooted problems of our societies laid bare by the
COVID-19 pandemic and which will require major structural
transformations and common shared solutions that are anchored in the
SDGs. To mobilize action, the Conference will seek to propel much needed
science-based innovative solutions aimed at starting a new chapter of
global ocean action.
Solutions for a sustainably managed ocean involve green technology and
innovative uses of marine resources. They also include addressing the
threats to health, ecology, economy and governance of the ocean –
acidification, marine litter and pollution, illegal, unreported and
unregulated fishing, and the loss of habitats and biodiversity.
