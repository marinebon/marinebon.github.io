The UN Ocean Conference (UNOC) was held in Lisbon from 27 June to 1 July
2022

The [UN Ocean Conference
(UNOC)](https://www.un.org/en/conferences/ocean2022), held in Lisbon
from 27 June to 1 July 2022, joined Heads of State and Government,
thousands of experts, business leaders, scientists, and civil society
representatives together, providing a space for meaningful dialogue and
seeking collaborations to conserve and conduct responsible use of the
oceans for sustainable development (SDG14).
\*\*Side Event: Marine life observations: Integrating biology and ecology
observations to enable indicators for conservation, restoration, and
sustainable development of marine and coastal ecosystems\*\*
The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) partnered with the
Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research (CIIMAR),
the Atlantic International Research Centre (AIR Centre), the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration U.S. Integrated Ocean Observation
System (U.S. IOOS), the Ocean Best Practices System (OBPS), the Ocean
Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), and the Global Ocean Observing
System (GOOS) of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) to
hold an in-person side event on 28 June 2022 as part of the UN Ocean
Conference.
Experts and stakeholders reviewed co-design strategies conducted under
the Marine Life 2030 Programme of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for
Sustainable Development, fostering a dialogue about stakeholder needs
for monitoring, information, capacity development, and the production of
indicators to support decision-making. The strategy is based on three
pillars of action: Learning Together, Observing Life, and Building
Solutions. The cross-cutting elements are efforts to share knowledge and
build communities, converge on standards for observing and data
management, and developing metrics of success through co-design.
The session promoted the integration of biological and ecological
observations into coastal and ocean observing systems and monitoring
programs; best practices that allow for the information to be
interoperable, scalable, and usable; collaborations that are in place to
support marine life monitoring and to exchange and adapt knowledge for
the benefit of human communities; and identifying gaps in knowledge and
understanding. The implementation includes the MBON Pole to Pole
framework for local observations of marine life and biodiversity using a
basin-scale framework for interoperability, building on regional
elements of the GOOS and guidelines for data flow developed by OBIS and
OBPS.
This goal is to better manage ocean uses and to satisfy national
reporting requirements for targets of [Sustainable Development
Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), the post-2020 Convention on
Biological Diversity, and other national and international frameworks
based on better, more accessible, and timely information about marine
life, including biodiversity, the distribution of species, productivity
and ecosystem function, and how this is changing over time.

\*\*Marine Life 2030 at the UN Ocean Decade Forum\*\*
A Marine Life 2030 video was showcased at the UN Ocean Decade Forum held
on 30 June 2022. This side event celebrated the challenges and outcomes
envisioned for the UN Ocean Decade in science, innovation, and
technology, as well as changes in society required for sustainable uses
of the ocean. The Forum showcased several endorsed UN Ocean Decade
Actions and provided a space for announcements from partners.
