An MBON Pole to Pole Workshop for Rocky Shore Monitoring in Uruguay was
held during the 1st-4th October, 20204, organized
by the Forum for the Conservation of the Patagonian Sea and Areas of
Influence, during a course coordinated by Karumbé and Vida Silvestre
Uruguay at Santa Teresa National Park.
Repeated monitoring with MBON Pole to Pole protocols will be coordinated
in Uruguay by Dr. Gabriela Vélez-Rubio (FCIEN-CURE, Udelar).

The monitoring focuses on capturing photo-quadrats in the rocky
intertidal zone and analyzing them using deep learning tools. The
protocol was co-designed during workshops coordinated by the Marine
Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) and CONICET, with the
participation of park rangers and wildlife rangers from Argentina and
Chile.
The activity in Santa Teresa, Uruguay, served as a first step toward
planning future workshops in Uruguay, which aim to incorporate this
monitoring into the country’s coastal protected areas.
